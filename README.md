# Retro Computer Graphics Google Doodle

My Google Doodle will be using the theme of retro computing. Retro computing is a subculture that celebrates the restoration and usage (or emulation) of older computers and video game consoles and the sound, graphics, and limitations of them, especially those in the 8-bit era. Examples include the Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 400/800 for computers, and Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Vectrex for consoles.
 
They generally had a very limited color palette, and some used vector graphics instead of the modern raster (using pixels) graphics. Vector graphics screens generally have a black background and a main drawing color of green, white, or amber, depending on the model of CRT screen the user had connected. Some allowed for multiple colors, and others were monochromatic.
 
These limitations required innovation and extreme optimization from developers.
